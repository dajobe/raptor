mKR serializer for raptor

mKR is a new output language for Raptor.
Since the Turtle Subject Predicate Object format is closest to
the format of simple mKR statements, I am modifying the Turtle
procedures to emit mKR syntax.

Future plans include adding an mKR parser. The more advanced
features of mKR will be translated to RDF, or flagged as errors.
