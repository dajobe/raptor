  <title>Raptor RDF Syntax Library - Building and Installing from Source</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Raptor RDF Syntax Library - Building and Installing from Source</h1>
  

<h2>1. Getting the sources</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get the sources.  The most stable and
tested versions are the sources shipped with each release and these
are recommended as the first place to start.  If you want to get a
newer set, then there are nightly snapshots made of the development
sources, which may not yet be committed to GIT.  For the
latest developent sources, anonymous GIT access is available
but this may require some configuring of developer tools that are not
needed for the snapshot releases.
</p>

<p>The source bundle and package files contain all the HTML files and
documentation provided on the web site.
</p>

<h2>1.1 Getting the sources from releases</h2>

<p><b>This is the recommended source to build and install raptor.</b>  It
ensures that a tested and working set of files are used.</p>

<p>The released sources are available from
<a href="http://download.librdf.org/source/">http://download.librdf.org/source/</a> (master site).
Do not use GitHub tagged tarballs, they are not the same thing and
are not supported.
</p>


<h2>1.2 Getting the sources from GIT</h2>

<p><b>This is the recommended source for developers</b>.  It provides
the latest beta or unstable code.  For a stable version, use a release
as described above.</p>

<pre>
  git clone git://github.com/dajobe/raptor.git
  cd raptor
</pre>

<p>At this stage, or after a <tt>git pull</tt> you will
need to create the automake and autoconf derived files, as described
below in <a href="#sec-create-configure">Create the configure program</a>
by using the <code>autogen.sh</code> script.
</p>

<p>Building Raptor in this way requires some particular development
tools not needed when building from snapshot releases - automake,
autoconf, libtool, gtkdocize and their dependencies.
The <code>autogen.sh</code> script looks for the newest versions of
the auto* tools and checks that they meet the minimum versions.
</p>

<p>gtkdocize can be found in the <code>gtk-doc-tools</code> package
on Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, <code>gtk-doc</code package
on RPM based systems such as Redhat and Fedora and in the homebrew
and macports package <code>gtk-doc</code> on OSX.</p>

<h2>2. Configuring and building</h2>

<p>Raptor uses the GNU automake and autoconf to handle system
dependency checking.  It is developed and built on x86 Linux
and x86 OSX but is also tested on other systems occasionally.
</p>

<p>Raptor has several optional libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The libxml2 XML library (2.6.8 or newer) for parsing XML syntaxes.</li>
  <li>Libcurl, libxml2 or libfetch for retrieving URIs.</li>
  <li>libxslt (requiring libxml2 also) to provide the XSLT functionality for the
    GRDDL and microformats parser.</li>
  <li><a href="http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/">YAJL</a> to provide JSON
    parsers if it is available.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.icu-project.org/">ICU</a> to provide
    Unicode NFC checking only if enabled with
    <code>--with-icu-config</code></li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="sec-create-configure" name="sec-create-configure"></a>2.1. Create <code>configure</code> program</h3>

<p>If there is a <code>configure</code> program, skip to the next
section.</p>

<p>If there is no <tt>configure</tt> program, you can create it 
using the <tt>autogen.sh</tt> script, as long as you have the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
tools.  This is done by:
</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>and you can also pass along arguments intended for configure (see
below for what these are):
</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/somewhere
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>On OSX you may have to explicitly set the <code>LIBTOOLIZE</code>
variable for the <code>libtoolize</code> utility since on
OSX <code>libtoolize</code> is a different program.  The full
path to the utility should be given:
</p>
<pre>
  LIBTOOLIZE=/opt/local/bin/glibtoolize ./autogen.sh
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively you can run them by hand with:
</p>
<pre>
  aclocal; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf
</pre>

<p>The automake and autoconf tools have many different versions and
at present development is being done with automake 1.11.1 (minimum
version 1.11), autoconf 2.65 (minimum version 2.62) and libtool 2.2.10
(minimum version 2.2.0).  These are only needed when compiling from
GIT sources.  autogen.sh enforces the requirements.
</p>

<p>Raptor also requires
<a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">flex</a> version 2.5.31 or newer
(2.5.4 will not work) and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">GNU Bison</a>
to build lexers and parsers.
These are only required when building from GIT.
</p>


<h3>2.2 Options for <tt>configure</tt></h3>

<p>Raptor's configure supports the following options:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>--disable-nfc-check</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Disable Unicode Normal Form C (NFC) checking code.
The code primarily consists of large tables plus some checking code
which can be removed from the library with this option.  All NFC
checks will succeed when this is disabled.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--enable-debug</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable debug messages (default not enabled).
Maintainer mode automatically enables this.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><tt>--enable-parsers=PARSERS</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick the RDF parsers to build from the list:<br />
<code>rdfxml ntriples turtle rss-tag-soup</code><br />
The default when this option is omitted is to enable all parsers.
<code>grddl</code> requires libxml2 and libxstl so may not always be
available.  If all parsers are not enabled, parts of the test suite
will likely fail.
</p>

<p>The parsers that a built library supports can be found from the
API level using functions such as
<code>raptor_parsers_enumerate</code> and
<code>raptor_syntaxes_enumerate</code> or from the
<code>rapper</code> utility in the help message.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--enable-serializers=SERIALIZERS</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick the RDF serializers to build from the list:<br />
<code>rdfxml ntriples rdfxml-abbrev</code><br />
The default when this option is omitted is to enable all serializers.
If all serializers are not enabled, parts of the test suite will
likely fail.
</p>

<p>The serializers that a built library supports can be found from the
API level using functions such as
<code>raptor_serializers_enumerate</code> or from the
<code>rapper</code> utility in the help message.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-memory-signing</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable signing of memory allocations so that when memory is
allocated with malloc() and released free(), a check is made that the
memory was allocated in the same library.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-www=NAME</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick a WWW library to use - either <tt>curl</tt>, 
<tt>xml</tt> (for libxml), <tt>libwww</tt> for W3C libwww or
<tt>none</tt> to disable it.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-xml2-config=NAME</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path to the libxml xml2-config program.
The default is to look for this on the PATH.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-xslt-config=NAME</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path to the libxslt xslt-config program.
The default is to look for this on the PATH.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-curl-config=NAME</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path to the <a
href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a> curl-config program.
The default is to look for this on the PATH.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-icu-config=NAME</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path to the <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/">ICU</a>
icu-config program. This will NOT be searched for on the PATH.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-libwww-config=NAME</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Legacy option that used to support the libwww library.
</p></dd>

<dt><tt>--with-yajl=DIR|no</tt><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Build against <a href="http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/">YAJL</a>
installed into directory <em>DIR</em> or with 'no', disable looking
for YAJL.  The default is to search a set of common installation directories
such /opt/local, /usr/local and /usr.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>2.3 Configuring</h3>

<p>The default configuration will install into /usr/local:
</p>
<pre>
   ./configure
</pre>

<p>To install into the standard Unix / Linux (and also Cygwin) system
directory, use:
</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
</pre>


<p>Append to the line any additional options you need like this:
</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-parsers=rdfxml
</pre>


<h3>2.4 Compiling</h3>

<p>Compile the library and the <tt>rapper</tt> utility with:
</p>
<pre>
   make
</pre>
<p>Note: GNU make is probably required which may be called
gmake or gnumake if your system has a different make available too.
</p>


<h3>2.5 Testing</h3>

<p>Raptor has a built-in test suite that can be invoked with:
</p>
<pre>
  make check
</pre>

<p>which should emit lots of exciting test messages to the screen but
conclude with something like:<br />
  <tt>All </tt><em>n</em><tt> tests passed</tt><br />
if everything works correctly. There will be some Unicode NFC
checking tests that give ignored failures in 1.3.2 or later as NFC
checking has been temporarily removed.
</p>


<h3>2.6 Installing</h3>

<p>Install the library and the <tt>rapper</tt> utility into the area
configure with <code>--prefix</code> (or /usr/local if not given)
with:</p>
<pre>
   make install
</pre>
<p>Note: This may require root access if the destination area is
a system directory such as /usr.  In that case you may have to do
<code>sudo make install</code>.
</p>


<h2>3. Using the library</h2>

<p>Raptor includes a full tutorial and reference manual
for the library.  These are installed into
<em>PREFIX</em><code>/share/gtk-doc/html/raptor</code>
and are also available from the
<a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/api/">Raptor web site</a>.
</p>

<p>In addition, the examples in the tutorial as well as some other
example programs are available in the <code>examples</code>
sub-directory.  These can be compiled with:
</p>
<pre>
   cd examples

   # Raptor GUI - only if you have the GTK libraries
   make grapper

   # If you have all requirements
   make examples
</pre>


<h3>3.2 rapper utility</h3>

<p>Raptor provides an RDF syntax utility program called
<em>rapper</em> which can do a variety of parsing and serializing operations.
</p>

<p>rapper can be run over RDF/XML content like this:
</p>

<pre>
  rapper http://librdf.org/raptor/raptor.rdf
</pre>

<p>Raptor can also extract RDF content inside general XML when the
<tt>-f scanForRDF</tt> feature is enabled.  For example if some
RDF/XML is embedded inside some SVG, it could be extracted with:
</p>

<pre>
  rapper -f scanForRDF /path/to/test/pic.svg
</pre>

<p>You can also run it on other syntaxes such as 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples">N-Triples</a>
files with the <code>-i</code> option like this:
</p>

<pre>
  rapper -i ntriples test.nt
</pre>

<p>The default output is a simple statement dump format, but it can
be changed to write
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples">N-Triples</a>
by using the <code>-o</code> option, like this:
</p>

<pre>
  rapper -o ntriples dc.rdf
</pre>


<p>See the rapper manual page for full details using 'man rapper'
or read the HTML version in docs/rapper.html or on the
<a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html">Raptor website</a>.
